## Term Paper

<ProjectCard>

  **The effect of private tutoring on academic performance of junior high school students**
  
  Apr. 2021 - Jun. 2021

  Course Instructor: Dr. Sergey Lychagin

  According to the panel data of China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), an OLS method was used to develop a baseline model with multiple levels of control variables and individual fixed effects to investigate the causal effect of participation in supplementary tutoring on learning performance.

  Considering the limitations of the OLS model itself and to solve the endogeneity issue, this paper also employs PSM method to study the ATT as a way to explore the role of private tutoring.

  The study found that participation in math tutoring did not significantly improve the standardized math scores of junior high school students and that participation in private tutoring did not pay off in terms of academic achievement.

  Grade of the term paper: 29/30.
